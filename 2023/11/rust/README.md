# Day 11 in Rust

- Uses complex numbers to save position $(x, y)$ as $z = x + yi$.
- The distance $d_T$ between the complex numbers $p$ and $q$ is the taxicab/Manhattan distance in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ calculated by: $|\mathbf{Re}(p) - \mathbf{Re}(q)| + |\mathbf{Im}(p) - \mathbf{Im}(q)|$.
